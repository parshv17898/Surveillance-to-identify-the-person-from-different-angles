# Surveillance-to-identify-the-person-from-different-angles
The surveillance to identify the person from different angles is basically also known as Person Re-identification. The deep learning model detects face of the person from images and videos. If any person can be seen in the image or video in any appearance then that person can be detected using this model. The deep learning model used was Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).

The dataset used was images of myself. I collected nearly 120 images of myself as the dataset and then I performed augmentation on it to increase the size of the dataset. Deep Learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are applied on the dataset. I tried different models to check the accuracy of the model and then I got the best accuracy for one of the models. At the end I got 100% training and 97% validation accuracy and 3.2908e-04 training and 0.0209 validation loss. 

I tried different models by just changing the number of layers in the Convolutional Neural Networks.
